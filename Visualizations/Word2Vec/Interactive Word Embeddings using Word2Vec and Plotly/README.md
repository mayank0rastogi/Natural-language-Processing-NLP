### In this Project What I learned ?
```
* How to preprocess a text dataset comprising recipes. 
* learnt how to use natural language processing techniques to generate word embeddings for these ingredients, 
  using Word2Vec. 
* These word embeddings can be used for recommendations in an online store based on added items in a basket, 
  or to suggest alternative items as replacements when stock is limited. 
* I am able to wbuild this recommendation/discovery feature in an interactive and aesthetic visualization tool.
