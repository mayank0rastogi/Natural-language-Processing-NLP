Week 2 Fine-tuning and evaluating large language models

## Learning Objectives
  
* Describe how fine-tuning with instructions using prompt datasets can improve performance on one or more tasks

* Define catastrophic forgetting and explain techniques that can be used to overcome it
  
* Define the term Parameter-efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT)

* Explain how PEFT decreases computational cost and overcomes catastrophic forgetting
  
* Explain how fine-tuning with instructions using prompt datasets can increase LLM performance on one or more
